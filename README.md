# Anderson Post - Storm Ideas Tech Test

I implemented all the required features.

Technologies used:

* React - bootstrapped with Create React App
* Typescript - it wasn't required, but I wanted to show some skills to the
* Sass with SCSS syntax and using BEM methodology for styles
* CSS modules for components styles isolation
* Axios for HTTP requests
* Dayjs - tiny library for working with time

No style frameworks or React frameworks because I wanted to show pure CSS and React / Typescript skills.

What is missing because of time limitation:

* no unit and e2e tests - although I write tests in all commercial projects 
  there was no time for this here -> I would use Jest with React Testing Library
  and for e2e I would use Cypress
* no placeholder component for not loaded images (sometimes not all images are
  loaded so for the future for better experience I would add placeholder images)
* no mobile menu on hamburger click (wasn't design for this so I considered this
  test as out of scope)

To start the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the directory and install dependencies type `yarn`
3. Type `yarn start`:
   Runs the app in the development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Enjoy!
